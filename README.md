Luman/Vue.js Game Store

## about

This project showcases the use case of how we use RESTful API to make the data fetching process faster and also make it easier to work with. We have created a gaming-facing app using Lumen/Laravel and Vue.js. We are fetching the data from the Lumen API that we created to fetch data for the studios. When you click on the icons, you will be able to see a list of the games that were published by that particular studio. In the game card, you will see the game's image, title, rating, and on which consoles the particular game is available, using the RAWG.io API. Additionally, we have created a search section where if you type the full name (with spaces if there) in the search bar, you will be able to see the particular game's cards for it. The search function is fetching all the data from the RAWG.io API.
